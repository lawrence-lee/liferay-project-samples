# Shared Language Keys

This sample project consists of two modules used to demonstrate how to share
language keys using OSGi services. The `language-web` module provides a simple
JSP portlet with defined language keys. The `language` resource module only
provides language keys, which are shared with the JSP portlet.

For more details explaining how the `language` and
`language-web` modules function together, see the following
