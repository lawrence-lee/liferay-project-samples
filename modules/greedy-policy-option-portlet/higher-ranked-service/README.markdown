# Higher Ranked Service

This sample module is one of two modules in the Greedy Policy Option portlet
used to demonstrate how to reference services using greedy and reluctant policy
options. The other module required for this demonstration is the
[`service-reference`](../service-reference) module.

For more details explaining how the `higher-ranked-service` and
`service-reference` modules function together, see the following
